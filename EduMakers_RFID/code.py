'''
This code plays a track depending on the approached object and has some user controls as well.

When the tag is read:
    a) Reads the info of the RFID tag and the langage selected
    b) Plays the folder and track selected (E. 1,1)
    c) An LED output shows when another tag can be read
    d) User can Pause/Play the track with the button
    e) User can also control the Volume with a potentiometer
